# To_do_list.py
Here's a description of the code implementation:

1.The code defines several functions to manage a To-Do List:

display_menu(): Displays the menu options for the user. view_todo_list(todo_list): Displays the current To-Do List. add_task(todo_list): Adds a task to the To-Do List. mark_completed(todo_list): Marks a task as completed and removes it from the list. delete_task(todo_list): Deletes a task from the To-Do List. main(): The main function that initializes the To-Do List and continuously prompts the user for actions until they choose to exit. Inside the main() function, a loop is used to repeatedly display the menu and process user input until the user chooses to exit.

2.Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called to perform the desired action.

3.The To-Do List is represented as a Python list (todo_list) where each element is a task.

4.The user interface is simple and text-based, making it easy to understand and use.

5.Input validation is implemented to handle cases where the user provides invalid input, such as entering an invalid task number.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a To-Do List application in Python, allowing users to manage tasks through a command-line interface.
